\arguments{
\item{species_params}{List with species parameters}

\item{initial_weight}{Initial weight in grams}

\item{ration_grams}{Daily ration in grams of prey}

\item{processed_data}{Processed input data}

\item{model_options}{Model options}

\item{oxycal}{Oxycalorific coefficient, default 13560}

\item{population_size}{Population size, default 1}

\item{output_daily}{Logical, whether to include daily output}

\value{
List with simulation results
}
\description{
Executes the simulation using a specific daily ration in grams.
Does not require iterative fitting as the consumption is fixed.
The p-value is calculated dynamically based on the ration and fish weight.
}
\details{
The ration is constant in absolute grams each day, regardless of fish weight.
The p-value is calculated dynamically based on: p = ration_grams / (weight * Cmax)
where Cmax is the maximum consumption rate at the given temperature.

This approach is useful when you have specific feeding data or want to
simulate controlled feeding experiments.
