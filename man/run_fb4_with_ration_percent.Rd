\description{
Executes the simulation using a specific ration as percentage
of daily body weight. Does not require iterative fitting.
The actual ration varies with fish weight throughout the simulation.
}
\details{
The ration is calculated as: daily_ration = (ration_percent/100) * current_weight
The p-value is calculated dynamically each day based on this ration.
This approach is common in aquaculture and experimental studies where
feeding rates are expressed as percentage of body weight.

As the fish grows, the absolute amount of food consumed increases
proportionally, which is more realistic than fixed gram amounts.
